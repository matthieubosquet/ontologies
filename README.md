# Ontologies

A collection of standard and well known ontologies serialised to [Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(syntax)).

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">
  <p>In computer science and information science, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a> encompasses a representation, formal naming and definition of the categories, properties and relations between the concepts, data and entities that substantiate one, many or all domains of discourse.</p>

## Core W3C ontologies

RDF, RDFS & OWL.

    <h3>Anyone Can Make Statements About Any Resource</h3>
    <p>To facilitate operation at Internet scale, RDF is an open-world framework that allows anyone to make statements about any resource.</p>
    <p>In general, it is not assumed that complete information about any resource is available. RDF does not prevent anyone from making assertions that are nonsensical or inconsistent with other statements, or the world as people see it. Designers of applications that use RDF should be aware of this and may design their applications to tolerate incomplete or inconsistent sources of information.</p>
